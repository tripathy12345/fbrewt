% =========================================================================
% function mfb=EWT_Meyer_FilterBank(boundaries,N)
%
% This function generate the filter bank (scaling function + wavelets)
% corresponding to the provided set of frequency segments
%
% Input parameters:
%   -boundaries: vector containing the boundaries of frequency segments (0
%                and pi must NOT be in this vector)
%   -N: signal length
%
% Output:
%   -mfb: cell containing each filter (in the Fourier domain), the scaling
%         function comes first and then the successive wavelets
